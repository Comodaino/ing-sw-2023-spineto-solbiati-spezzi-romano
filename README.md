## Tests

These are screenshot directly from intellij showing coverage fo our tests, since the common goals are so many and each match doesn't use more than two of them, we decided to test them separately

## Execution

Java 20 is required by the project

### To execute the both client and server just execute the jar with (127.0.0.1 will be the default ip on which the client tries to connect): 

```

## JAR
- [Latest release](https://github.com/Comodaino/ing-sw-2023-spineto-solbiati-spezzi-romano/releases/latest)

## Docker

To test portability and compatibility of the app, we created a docker container to run the app (the app was also tested on two fresh linux installation (Arch and Garuda)

To build the container: 
```
sudo docker build -t nameOfTheImage .
```
To run the container: 
```
sudo docker run -p -i -t nameOfTheImage
```
Docker is required to create and run the image, to create the image copy in a new folder both Dockerfile and the jar executable
